JKM cdc
	- exchange partition in odi - switching partion between tables - odi km - new km 

for real time integration- 
	- we can cdc jrn$date field
	- we can alternatively row_id 

100gb data - how to dump to oracle - sqlloader - high level watermark - 
	drawback - table lock insert append mode
	LKM

agents  - standalone
		- collocated
		- j2ee - high avaliablity env
				- speed consistancy
				- connection pooling *****
				- load balancing

bulk commit - 
	-- roll back even after commit 
		- savepoints
	-- transaction isolation
	-- undo redo logs - at dba level
	-- exception handling within bulk 
		- "save exception clause"
		- pragma autonomous exceptions
		
table partitioning
	-- range partion
	-- exchnage partion

direct path inserts
	- high water mark 
	- how to start: use these hints
		- append - single cpu
		- parallel - parallel threads
					- multiple cpus
						- in case of failure 

trigger basiscs - NO you cant commit in triggers

1. How would you load several files in parallel into a table + exception handling
2. How would you load a 100gb orac table to table
3. How do we eliminate LKM if we have data present in 2 data servers.
4. what are the disadvantages of bitmap index? what other indexes do we have?
6. why use partitions? how would you access a partition? 
7. Oracle GTT - global temp tabels
8. where is the data of a view in oracle stored
